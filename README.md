# AboutAndSysInfo Library

The AboutAndSysInfo library enhances your project About dialog enabling you to add a dialog that contains the project name, which comes from your application object, the version information from the executable and a very much extended and organized system information dialog. A user can pretty much find all system information related to the application in a treeview style view.

###### How to use? 

Simply add the library to your workspace and add the about.dg to the project code and the rest is handled for you.
